                <p>I wish to appreciate the doctor, sisters, nurses and the other staff for all the services and 
                    support that was provided to me (room 108) and my family (room 137) during our stay at the Intermediate
                     Care Centre. From the 4th of June, you all gave us the mental strength to recover from the sickness in our
                      minds and bodies due to COVID-19. Medicine, food and other needs were tended to with care. I look forward to
                       other future patients receiving the same brave service.</p>

                <h2>Mr Prem</h2>
                <p>I was experiencing pain and blood in my stools even after my previous medication so I came 
                    to Hayat Hospital. The team at Hayat, with their modern equipment, helped me locate a tumour
                     growing in the mid-rectal region through a colonoscopy. This is where a video camera attached to the
                      tube was inserted and a biopsy was done to confirm it was a bowel cancer tumour. After confirmation, 
                      my doctor , who has been a laparoscopic bowel surgeon for 5 years, 
                      performed the laparoscopy surgery (total laparoscopy anterior (ultra-low)) which was minimally invasive and 
                      quick, because they made incisions to the skin to insert cameras and equipment instead of doing an open surgery 
                      which would have taken me more time to recover. The normal procedure would have been done in two stages with
                       an opening in the abdomen (stoma) and a bag (colostomy bag), but this surgery was performed in one go, 
                       avoiding all these steps which was much easier for me to handle mentally and physically. 
                       This helped me recover faster. Because only after 5 days of admission, 
                       I recovered and was discharged, all thanks to the rapid response by the team and doctors at Hayat, 
                       and their latest technology and modern techniques.</p>

                <h2>Mr. Su Feng Duan</h2>
                <p>Hayat Hospital is brilliant. I came in to the Durdans Accident and Emergency Unit
                     when the pain in the right side of my abdomen became severe and I had a high fever and a low appetite.
                      The team at Durdans were incredible. They provided a translator, and ran some blood tests. On the same day,
                       they referred me to best doctor who is highly experienced. Through advanced diagnostic tools, 
                       the doctor found that we had to remove my punctured appendix. An emergency laparoscopic surgery was done 
                       immediately on the same day. Doctor and the skilled nurses made sure the surgery was done smoothly
                        with no issues or delays because this was an emergency situation and my appendix was removed.
                         Unlike an open surgery, there were no major cuts so I was able to recover much faster. After my surgery,
                          I was able to move around and eat well, all thanks to the amazing team at Durdans who acted rapidly to 
                          help treat me and made sure I was well-looked after since day 1.</p>
